# CoffeeMachineSimulation

The purpose of the work was to create a project with all the schemes of interaction and operation of the software. It was necessary to develop such schemes as: structural diagram, use cases, requirements diagram, machine state diagrams, sequence diagram and activity diagram. You can get acquainted with the schemes in the protocol.

The work was done in pairs: everyone makes their own diagrams, and then we change and implement the project in practice. According to my partner's diagrams, I implemented a simulation of a coffee maker, which shows the data on the sensors when starting the coffee maker. The user must meet all the conditions to make coffee. The coffee maker has many options for grinding, coffee strength and two recipes - Americano and espresso, which consume different amounts of resources.
